    "Description": "We’re a boutique Drupal shop, proud to call Toronto home, that creates user-focused websites for our clients in higher education and the B2B space. Projects typically include UX, design, development, maintenance and support, and post-launch training. --- Our Capabilities --- UX Design We’ll start with research to determine what your users need from your site. Then we’ll help you make sure that everything you publish—graphics, layout, text, and other content—contributes to helping those users achieve their goals. Content Strategy Based on our UX research, we’ll help you plan your site structure so your users can accomplish their goals. We’ll also help you get a handle on all your content, so nothing valuable gets lost when you relaunch your site. Web Development We design exclusively in Drupal and WordPress, open-source platforms that offer our clients unrivalled freedom and flexibility. That means you won’t be tied down to one vendor or struggle to find specialized talent that can maintain an archaic CMS. Ongoing Support After your site is live, we’ll help skill up your content team to keep your new site at its best. And we’ll always be there if something goes wrong, with attention to detail and white-glove service. And when it’s time to redesign or revisit? We’d be happy to help. --- Why Foster Interactive? --- We’re all about user experience research. By discovering what your audience wants, we enable your users to tell you how to solve their problems. That makes your website more successful from the minute it launches. We use the most effective tools. We work primarily with Drupal—the most extensible platform in the world—and build less-complex projects in WordPress. That keeps you from getting locked in with one vendor. We don’t have a “B-Team.” Unlike larger agencies, the team you meet at the start of your relationship with Foster will be your team for the duration of your website build. We’re with you for the long haul. Using our research data, we work hard to build trust and consensus among your team—then help you get buy-in from senior leadership. Your goals become ours. We don’t “launch and leave.” One of our clients has been with us for more than a decade, and our average engagement is five years and counting. (We’re still working with all of them.)"
